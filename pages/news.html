        <p>More than 500 firefighters supported by 18 planes and helicopters worked throughout the night and on Friday to tackle the blaze near the village of Villanueva de Viver.

            Emergency services evacuated eight communities, said Gabriela Bravo, the regional head of interior affairs.
            
            Power was cut in some areas and at least three roads were closed by the authorities.
            
            “We were told to leave as quickly as possible. We grabbed pyjamas and that was that,” an elderly woman told RTVE.
            “We are all very concerned,” said Miguel Sandalinas, the mayor of Montanejos, a town of about 550 people affected by the
            evacuations.
            
            The AEMET state weather service reported that firefighting was being hampered by high winds, low humidity and temperatures above 20C (68F), relatively high for this time of year.</p>
